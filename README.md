# Spritesheet Generator
A script that generates a sprite sheet from multiple image files.
While working on pixelart I found it easier to just work on single 16x16 pixel art assets and then save them in a folder. This script stitches them together.

By default it creates a square sheet.
if images are of the format <row><col>image.png it will insert the image into specific position.
Ex : 34image.png
